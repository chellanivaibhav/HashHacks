Currently the health care system has several problems.

There is no mechanism for DR`s to look at a patient’s complete history .
It is difficult to move records from state to state or country to country.
Individuals don’t have control over their own health information.
A patient`s data is private and if it falls in the wrong hands it may prove dangerous .
It is hard for people to educate themselves about their own health.
Understanding a diagnosis and seeking further opinions is usually difficult.
Not all DR's have compatible systems to view different types of data/files.
How do you know what your doctor has trained in and how do they compare to other doctors or other therapies.
How do you find healthcare providers to review your case. -Billing and insurance can be a problem when moving interstate or internationally .
How do you pay for services internationally.
We are trying to make a permissioned blockchain with IPFS where we will store all patient records . The patient will be able to allow drs to review his records and will have complete comtrol over his documents .

We will be using Quorum blockchain for this . Will update the readme with details
