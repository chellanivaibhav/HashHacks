Currently the health care system has several problems. 

- There is no mechanism for DR`s to look at a patient’s complete history .
- It is difficult to move records from state to state or country to country. 
- Individuals don’t have control over their own health information. 
- A patient`s data is private and if it falls in the wrong hands it may prove dangerous .
- It is hard for people to educate themselves about their own health.
- Understanding a diagnosis and seeking further opinions is usually difficult. 
- Not all DR's have compatible systems to view different types of data/files. 
- How do you know what your doctor has trained in and how do they compare to other doctors or other therapies. 
- How do you find healthcare providers to review your case. -Billing and insurance can be a problem when moving interstate or   internationally .
- How do you pay for services internationally.
